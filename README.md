# **TinyApp Project for Lighthouse Labs**

TinyApp is a full stack web application that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly). TinyApp is built with Node and Express.

## Features 

- Create and store your short versions of valid URLs
- Made a typo? TinyApp allows you to update/delete any of your shortened URLs 

## Final Product

!["Welcome page display which prompts the user to login or register"]()

!["Main page containing all of the user's short URLs"]()

!["Edit page allowing users to update their short URLs"]()

*Specific short URL page where user owns the short URL*
